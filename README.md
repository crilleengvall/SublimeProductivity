This plugin started as a joke between me and a colleague. We sit in an open office at work.
I've always had my desk in a corner before, and no one could see whats on my computer monitors.
One day this changed and i got a desk in the middle of the room, with my monitors facing a way so that all prying eyes could
see what i did all day. How do i check my social medias without being caught? Well... you mask the tweets as a class in your IDE 
ofcourse :)

This plugin adds a new menu called "Productivity", and asks twitter via oauth to get your twitter home feed. Then the plugin creates
a python class(that is trying to follow the PEP8) standard. This way you don't have to open a browser and go to twitter.com.

Note: As said this is plugin does what i've said it does, but checking social medias at the place i works is not a problem. This plugin is created because i wanted to learn how to make one for sublime.
